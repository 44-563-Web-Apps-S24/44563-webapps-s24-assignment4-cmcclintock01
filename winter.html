<h4 class="borkin">BORKIN.</h4> <p class="speech">Come, tell me if you would be sorry or not.</p>

<h4 class="ivanoff">IVANOFF.</h4> <p class="speech">I am sorry that you smell so of vodka, Misha, it is disgusting.</p>

<h4 class="borkin">BORKIN.</h4> <p class="speech">Do I smell of vodka? How strange! And yet, it is not so strange
after all. I met the magistrate on the road, and I must admit that we
did drink about eight glasses together. Strictly speaking, of course,
drinking is very harmful. Listen, it is harmful, isn't it? Is it? Is it?</p>
