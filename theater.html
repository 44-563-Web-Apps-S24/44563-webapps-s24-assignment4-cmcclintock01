        <h1>Corben McClintock does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>Invanoff Act 1 by Anton Chekov</h2>
        <pre>
            The garden of IVANOFF'S country place. On the left is a terrace and the
facade of the house. One window is open. Below the terrace is a broad
semicircular lawn, from which paths lead to right and left into a
garden. On the right are several garden benches and tables. A lamp is
burning on one of the tables. It is evening. As the curtain rises sounds
of the piano and violoncello are heard.

<h4 class="ivanoff">IVANOFF</h4> <p class="direction">is sitting at a table reading.</p>

<h4 class="borkin">BORKIN,</h4> <p class="direction">in top-boots and carrying a gun, comes in from the rear of the
garden. He is a little tipsy. As he sees IVANOFF he comes toward him on
tiptoe, and when he comes opposite him he stops and points the gun at
his face.</p>

<h4 class="ivanoff">IVANOFF.</h4> <p class="direction">[Catches sight of BORKIN. Shudders and jumps to his feet]</p>
<p class="speech">Misha! What are you doing? You frightened me! I can't stand your stupid
jokes when I am so nervous as this. And having frightened me, you laugh!</p>
<p class="direction">[He sits down.]</p>

<h4 class="borkin">BORKIN.</h4> <p class="direction">[Laughing loudly]</p> <p class="speech">There, I am sorry, really. I won't do it
again. Indeed I won't.</p> <p class="direction">[Take off his cap]</p> <p class="speech">How hot it is! Just think, my
dear boy, I have covered twelve miles in the last three hours. I am worn
out. Just feel how my heart is beating.</p>


<h4 class="ivanoff">IVANOFF.</h4> <p class="direction">[Goes on reading]</p> <p class="speech">Oh, very well. I shall feel it later!</p>

<h4 class="borkin">BORKIN.</h4> <p class="speech">No, feel it now.</p> <p class="direction">[He takes IVANOFF'S hand and presses it against
his breast]</p> <p class="speech">Can you feel it thumping? That means that it is weak and
that I may die suddenly at any moment. Would you be sorry if I died?</p>

<h4 class="ivanoff">IVANOFF.</h4> <p class="speech">I am reading now. I shall attend to you later.</p>

<h4 class="borkin">BORKIN.</h4> <p class="speech">No, seriously, would you be sorry if I died? Nicholas, would you
be sorry if I died?</p>

<h4 class="ivanoff">IVANOFF.</h4> <p class="speech">Leave me alone!</p>
